    If the pacing of a course run is updated, we should check to see if the update potentially requires us to remove a
    certificate available date (CAD) associated with the previous configuration. Specifically, we need to ensure that we
    are removing a CAD associated with the course run's certificate configuration in the Credentials IDA. Other date or
    display behavior related changes are handled when the `COURSE_CERT_DATE_CHANGE` signal is fired by the system (see
    the `handle_course_cert_date_change` signal receiver above).

    This signal receiver is needed for an edge case where an instructor-paced course run associated with a CAD is
    updated to be self-paced. The Credentials IDA doesn't understand the concept of "course pacing" so we must ensure
    an update is fired to clean up any invalid available date data.

    When received, and if applicable, we should enqueue celery tasks reponsible for:
